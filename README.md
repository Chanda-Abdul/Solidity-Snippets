## HardHat Setup
````
mkdir DIRECTORY
cd DIRECTORY
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
````
````
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
````
- `run.js` is like our testing grounds where we want to make sure our contracts core functionality works before we go and deploy it. It's really hard to debug contract code and frontend code at the same time, so, we separate it out!

### ‚úàÔ∏è Re-deploy
So, now that we've updated our contract we need to do a few things:
1. We need to deploy it again.
````
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
````
2. We need to update the contract address on our frontend.
3. We need to update the abi file on our frontend. 


People constantly forget to do these 3 steps when they change their contract. Don't forget lol.
Why do we need to do all this? Well, it's because smart contracts are <b>immutable</b>. That means changing a contract requires a full redeploy. This will also reset all the variables since it'd be treated as a brand new contract. That means we'd lose all our wave data if we wanted to update the contract's code.


### Hardhat Starter Contract

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract MyContract {
    constructor() {
        console.log("Yo yo, I am a contract and I am smart");
    }
}
